## Introduction

This repository contains the various Papyrus scripts I have created for my various [Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/) and [Skyrim Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/) mods. All of my mods can be downloaded from the Nexus (see links below).

These scripts are available for use by anyone creating their own mods for Skyrim and Skyrim Special Edition. If you want to use code from my scripts in your own mods, please feel free to do so. There is no need to credit me for my work, unless you'd like to.

NOTE: at present, only Zim's Immersive Artifacts scripts are available; these are part of my upcoming update. I will include descriptions of function within the scripts for ease of reference in future. I will also soon make available scripts for [Zim's Dragon Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38693), [Zim's Dremora Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12128/?), and [Zim's Falkreath Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35672?tab=description).
